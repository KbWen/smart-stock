# /adr - Architecture Decision Record Workflow

AI autonomously creates standardized architectural decision records. These capture the reasoning behind significant technical choices so future sessions understand not just what was decided, but why.

## When to Create an ADR

Create an ADR when a decision:
- Affects >1 module or crosses architectural boundaries
- Is hard to reverse (data model changes, API contracts, dependency choices)
- Was contentious or had multiple viable alternatives
- Was promoted from a `/decide` entry (decision too significant for inline recording)

For smaller decisions, `/decide` is sufficient — don't create ADRs for every choice.

## Execution Steps

1. **Check existing ADRs**: `ls .agentcortex/adr/` to find the next available ID and avoid duplicating existing records.

2. **Allocate ID**: Use sequential numbering (e.g., ADR-005). Keep the kebab-case suffix descriptive.

3. **Generate content**: Create `.agentcortex/adr/ADR-[ID]-[name].md` with:
   - **Status**: Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded by ADR-[N]
   - **Context**: What problem prompted this decision? What constraints apply?
   - **Decision**: What exactly are we doing? Be specific enough that someone can verify compliance.
   - **Alternatives Considered**: What other options existed and why were they rejected?
   - **Consequences**: Both positive and negative impacts of this decision.

4. **Link from affected code**: Add references in relevant specs, code comments, or the Work Log. An unlinked ADR is an invisible ADR.

5. **Update SSoT index**: If this ADR relates to an active spec, note it in `.agentcortex/context/current_state.md` under the relevant feature.
